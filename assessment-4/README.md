## 📅 Week 3: ReactJS & Modern Frontend Integration
- **Goal**: Move from "Server-Side Rendering" (Blade/Twig) to "Client-Side State" and API orchestration.
- **React 18/19 Patterns**:
    - Hooks over Lifecycle methods; [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for lightweight state.
    - The "Server State" Revolution: Mastering [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) for caching, pagination, and optimistic updates.
- **Security**:
    - Stateless Auth: Implementing JWT with [FastAPI Security](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/) and React Context.
- **Assessment 4**:
    - Task: Build a "Student management" system in React that debounces inputs and uses TanStack Query to fetch results from a FastAPI endpoint with proper error boundaries.
